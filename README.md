# Data visualization

data visualization is typically the final step in your analysis. To have a figure that is easily readable, conveys information succinctly, and is not too overwhelming is the goal. In order to accomplish that task, your data must be cleaned, your data must be structured how you wish to present it, and your analysis must be complete. This guide will for the most part assume that those three steps are complete, though we will include a bit of all three at times. 

Picking the right plot type can be difficult for new analysts. There are use cases for just about any kind of relationship you want to visualize. You can also choose multiple types of plots for each type of relationship. That being said, there are some plots that make the relationships you wish to present more convoluted or are excessive for your needs. Below is a table that I hope you find helpful.

| Data type     | Plot type |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|Univariate, contionuous  | Box-whisker  |
|Univariate, categorical  | Barplots |
|Bivaraite, categorical,continuous | Line plot, stacked barplot|
|Bivaraite, continuous,continuous | Scatterplot|
|Multivariate| Grouping|
